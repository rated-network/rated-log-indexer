# Contributing to slaOS Indexer

We welcome contributions to the slaOS indexer project! This document outlines the process for contributing and building custom adapters.

## Custom Adapters

If you have a unique data source or integration need, you can build a custom adapter for the slaOS indexer. Our open-source indexer architecture allows for easy extension.

### To build a custom adapter:

1. Fork the slaOS indexer repository
2. Implement the adapter interface (documentation provided in the repo)
3. Test your adapter with sample data
4. Submit a pull request for review and inclusion in the main slaOS project

The main repository can be found at: https://github.com/rated-network/rated-log-indexer/tree/main

### Best practices for custom adapters:

* Follow the provided code style and documentation guidelines
* Implement robust error handling and logging
* Provide clear configuration options for users
* Include unit and integration tests

To maintain the highest standards of quality and reliability for our users, we carefully review all submissions to ensure they meet these guidelines. Adherence to these practices is essential for the acceptance and integration of custom adapters into the slaOS ecosystem.
